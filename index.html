              <h3>Kedar</h3>
              <p><span class="h2">A</span>ccording to Hindu mythology, the temple was built by the Pandavas, the legendary heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. As per legends, after the great Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas wanted to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva to atone for their sins. However, Lord Shiva was not pleased with them and refused to meet them. The Pandavas then followed him to the Himalayas, where he took refuge in the form of a bull. The Pandavas then built temples at the sites to worship Lord Shiva in his bull form where they found the body parts of the bull. Kedarnath Temple was the site where the hump of the bull was seen. The current temple is believed to have been built by Adi Shankara in the 8th century CE. However, the temple has undergone several renovations over the centuries due to damage caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes and avalanches. The current structure is believed to have been built in the 19th century. </p>

                      <p class="card-text text-dark "><span class="h5 text-dark">N</span>andi (Sanskrit: नन्दि), is the bull vahana of the Hindu god Shiva, meaning happiness, joy, and satisfaction. He is also the guardian deity of Kailash, the abode of Shiva. Almost all Shiva temples display stone images of a seated humped, white Nandi, reclining on a raised platform generally facing the main shrine continuously staring at the god. Nandi is one of Shiva’s chief attendants, occasionally depicted in sculpture as a bull-headed figure.
                        Nandi is also discerned in an entire human form as Nandikeshwara or Nandideva, such sculptured forms are found at the entrance door of many Shaivite temples in South India, and are frequently confused with images of the deity because they are alike in such iconographic features as the third eye, crescent moon in the matted locks, and four arms, two of which hold the battle-axe and an antelope. However, a distinguishing feature is that Nandi’s hands are pressed together in adoration.
                        Nandi got the divine knowledge of Agamic and Tantric wisdom taught by Shiva, from the goddess Parvati. He is considered the chief guru of eight disciples of Nandinatha Sampradaya, namely Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Tirumular, Vyagrapada, Patanjali, and Sivayoga Muni. These eight disciples were sent in eight different directions of the world by Nandi, to spread this knowledge.

                   <p class="card-text"><span class="h5 text-dark">T</span>ri meaning three and Shool meaning spear, the weapon held by Lord Shiva is of great significance. Though this weapon has been held by a lot of other deities, too, the one held by Lord Shiva is said to have many properties. It is believed that Shiva’s Trishool destroys the physical world which is illusion, the mental world which is ego and then takes us to the third world which is spiritualism.
                     As per Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva had severed Ganesha’s head with the Trishool and then later replaced it with that of an elephant. The three blades of Trishool are believed to reperesent Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Lord Brahma is the creator of the universe, Lord Vishnu is the caretaker and Lord Mahadev is the destroyer of all evil.
                     Some people have spoken of the trident as a destructive weapon, but it is not so in the case of trident held by Lord Shiva. With the presence of the three main devtaas, the Trishool is the destructor of the physical world which drags the mankind away from the spiritual connection. It represents holiness and good deeds and is said to remove the troubles of past, present and future. The Trishool formed in the human body represents the 3 energy sources namely ida( इड़ा), pingla(पिंगला) and sushumna(सुषुम्ना). Sushumna, the 7th chakra, is in the centre and known as the main centre of energy. When energy reaches this chakra, the external happenings do not have any negative effect on the human body. The two other parts ida and pingla are Shiv and Shakti on the basis of their properties.

He was the one who first put this seed into the human mind.  According to the yogic lore, over fifteen thousand years ago,  Shiva attained to his full enlightenment and abandoned himself in an  intense ecstatic dance upon the Himalayas. When his ecstasy allowed him some movement, he danced wildly. When it became beyond movement, he became utterly still.
            People saw that he was experiencing something that nobody had known before, something that they were unable to fathom. Interest developed and people came wanting  to know what this was. They came, they waited and they left because the man was oblivious  to other people’s presence. He was either in intense dance or absolute stillness, completely  uncaring of what was happening around him. Soon, everyone left…
